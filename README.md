| Description | Please see attached to this answer the capacity utilisation level of each Tube line by hour on a typical weekday. <br/>A second table tallies whether this value is over 50 per cent and a third estimates whether all seats are taken. <br/>Please note Transport for London (TfL) does not have a way to monitor train loadings accurately in real time. <br/>Although it holds ticketing data, this only indicates where customers entered and exited the network, not which route they took within it. <br/>This analysis is based on the typical weekday TfL uses for planning purposes, where a combination of survey data and assignment modelling are used to determine the combination of routes passengers are likely to have taken through the network. |
